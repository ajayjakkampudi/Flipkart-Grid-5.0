## Problem Statement: Conversational Fashion Outfit Generator powered by GenAI
  - Create a Generative AI-powered fashion outfit generator for Flipkart that revolutionizes how users discover and create personalized fashion outfits, in a natural conversational way.
  - The fashion outfit generator should be able to analyze a user's past purchase history and understand their preferred style, color choices, and favorite brands. By considering these preferences, the generator should suggest outfits that align with the user's unique fashion taste.
  - The fashion outfit generator should tap into social media trends to provide up-to-date fashion recommendations. It should be able to analyze current fashion trends, styles, and influencers on platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, and fashion blogs. By combining this data with the user's preferences, the generator can suggest outfits that are not only personalized but also in line with the latest fashion trends.

<ul>
  <li>
    Fashion Outfit Generator is the AI model based on Fine-tuned Stable Diffusion Model which analyzes user preferences, past purchases, and browsing behavior to suggest personalized fashion outfits and can generate clothing images.

</picture> Proposed Solution :</h2></div>
<ul>
  <li> The proposed implementation for our conversational generative AI outfit is based on the innovative utilization of the Stable Diffusion Model. </li>
  <li>Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model based on diffusion techniques. It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text     descriptions.</li>
  <li>Another approach that can be implemented was Generative and Adversarial Neural Networks.
    But here we preferred stable diffusion because its stability and gradual convergence are critical. </li>
